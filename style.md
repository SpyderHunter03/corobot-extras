# General

- Always use four spaces to indent.
- Always indent a new block of code (e.g., inside a class, function, or if/for/while/etc. block).
- Class names are always `UpperCase`.
- Always separate operators and operands with spaces: `x + y` or `x = y`, NOT `x+y` and NOT `x=y`.
- Never put a space between a function and its arguments: `f(x)`, NOT `f (x)` or `f( x )`.
- Always separate function arguments with spaces: `f(a, b, c)`, NOT `f(a,b,c)`.
- Always put a space between if/for/while/etc. statements and their expressions: `if (n == 1) {`, NOT `if(n == 1){`. They aren't functions.
- Always use K&R ("Egyptian") style brackets:

        int f(int x) {
            return x;
        }

- Do not do one-line if/for/while/etc. statements. Break them into two lines and use braces.
- Try to break code into logical paragraphs and comment each one. If you look at code a week later and can't tell what it's doing, you didn't write good enough comments for anyone else to understand it either.
- Three import paragraphs: language defaults, third-party packages, and own packages. For example:

        import math
        
        import rospy
        
        from corobot_common.msg import Pose

- Put imports in alphabetical order within each paragraph.

# Java, C++, Dart

- Always name variables and methods using `camelCase`.
- Create full Javadoc style comments for every method.

# Python

- Adhere to [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in all things, especially:
- Always name variables and functions using `lower_case_with_underscores`.
- Use the [proper documentation style](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). For example, a simple function:

        def double(x):
            """Multiplies x by two."""
            return x * 2

    Or a more complex function:

        def f(x, y, z):
            """Does <something complicated>.
            
            x -- <describe x>
            y -- <describe y>
            z -- <describe z>
            Returns <something>.
            
            """
            <several lines of code>
            return <result>

# C++

- Pointer stars always go with types: `int* x`.
- Reference symbols go with the variable: `int &x`.
