# Landmark Data

## pointDataMap.xcf/png

Landmark points are overlayed on the map of the 3rd floor.  
This gives us "map" (pixel) x-y coordinates that can then be converted to "real" (meter) x-y coordinates.

## waypoints.ods

LibreOffice spreadsheet of complete landmark graph data.  
Provides landmark name, coordinates (map and real), and neighbor list.
