## build-notes.md

## "Diagrams"
These .graphml files and their png exports show a high-level breakdown of separation of functionality between the different parts of the corobot project.

.graphml files can be edited with yEd, www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html

Please update these to reflect any corrections/confusions!

## API.md

Detailed description of the protocol for client-robot communications

## corobot_tower_pieces.odg
LibreOffice Draw description of the pieces of the acrylic tower on which the laptop sits and sensors are mounted.  The hope is that the file is suitable for export into whatever format is needed to get pieces cut for us.

## user-api.txt
A loose guide to the functionality that a client library should provide.  More details available in the libraries repository.
